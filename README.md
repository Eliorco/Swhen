<h1>Surf Alarm!</h1>
<br>
<h3>A surf score/notify service for self use, catch them all!</h3>

This is a simple API wrapper for MagicseaWeed with the addition of "best time to surf" or "wave, form and height threshold"

prerequisite:
1. ask MSW for api creds
2. clone my repo and adjust it to your location
3. run it and get a summarized surf sessions for the next few days
4. go out there and surf 

You can connect this service to a bot to remind you when you can surf
